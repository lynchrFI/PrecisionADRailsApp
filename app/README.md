#Precision Auto Detailing
PAD is an application designed to help auto detailers keep track of their clients along with their appointments. 

## Installation
To get the app up and running, fork and clone this repo in your terminal:

``https://github.com/lynchrFI/PrecisionADRailsApp``

You'll need to cd into the project directory and run ``bundle install``. All the gem dependancies will then be installed.

## Running Tests

In the terminal, please run ``rails s``. It will open up a local server address where you can route to that address and look at the project. It will look something like this:

> http://localhost:3000/

## App Navigation

The first window users are greeted with is a welcome page! From there you can sign up for an account through the website or with Facebook. After that, you can go ahead and start adding clients and appointments to your schedule!
